Future Features (Planned)
These are planned ideas, not promises; details may change as we learn more.
Note: keep this in sync with `ExpeditionsContent/ROADMAP.md`.

- Revamp rainbow quest title coloring.
  Current rainbow text is tied to the "important/challenger" flag rather than a clear difficulty signal. This feels arbitrary and can confuse players about why a quest is highlighted. We want to replace this with a more meaningful visual language (likely based on real difficulty or questline priority), and make the meaning obvious at a glance without needing mod knowledge.
- Revamp slider blip colors and category filter colors/icons.
  The top bar blip colors currently reflect quest rarity/difficulty (and a special daily highlight), while the category filter icons/colors are unrelated. This mismatch makes it hard to interpret what the colors mean. We want a consistent, explainable system that aligns blip colors, category filters, and quest difficulty/importance, with clearer labels or legends so players understand the UI without guessing.
